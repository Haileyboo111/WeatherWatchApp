## Weather Watch

Our web application is a modern, user-friendly weather advisory platform specifically designed to assist users in planning trips well in advance. While traditional weather applications focus primarily on providing current and short-term forecasts, our app sets itself apart by allowing users to organize and save future travel plans with associated forecast data for those specific dates and locations. In addition to providing accurate daily and weekly weather reports, users can receive real-time weather emergency alerts relevant to their saved trips and regions of interest.

## Reflection
 
This is a semester-long project from August to December 2025. Project goals include familiarizing ourselves with new technologies, such as React, and applying what we have learned about Scrum and past classes.  

Originally, we wanted to build an application that allows users to check the weather and stay up to date on any weather emergencies using WeatherAPI. We began this process by creating the skeleton of our website, both on the frontend and backend, using React components.

One of the main challenges we face is using React. We have spent days researching how to build a React environment to run our code and debug accordingly. We have also received help from Computer Science tutors at school for some guidance. Due to sprint constraints, we focused more on writing a clear skeleton on how we want our app to appear and adding the WeatherAPI to the backend.

Lastly, the technologies implemented in this project are React, JavaScript, CSS, and JSX. We wanted to use the `create-react-app` to minimize the initial setup and have an easier time running the app. In the next sprint, we plan on resolving the React environment issue we are receiving and hope to debug our code.
