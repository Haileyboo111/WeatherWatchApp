# Created by: Breona Saffouri
# Status: Template - Database configuration needed

# HANDOFF NOTES FOR DATABASE INTEGRATION:
# 1. Update the 'db' service with proper database image (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
# 2. Configure database environment variables (user, password, database name)
# 3. Add volume mounts for database persistence
# 4. Update backend environment variables to connect to database
# 5. Test database connectivity between services
# 6. Consider adding health checks for database readiness
